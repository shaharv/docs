Singletone

- Why singletones are bad:
  - Introduce a global state
  - Require thread safety
  - Make code much less flexible
  - Make testing difficult

- Alternative:
  - Even if we want a class to be instantiated only once, it's not necessarily harmful to have more than one.
  - If we do want to limit to exactly one, can use static.
  - We normally don't need the global scope of a singletone.

SOLID
-----

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)

  S - Single responsibility principle
      a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in 
      the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).

  O - Open/closed principle
      software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

  L - Liskov's substitution principle
      objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without 
      altering the correctness of that program.

  I - Interface segregation principle
      many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

  D - Dependency inversion principle
      one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
