Codelite basics
---------------

Debug shortcuts:

- F5         Start debug
- Shift+F5   Stop debug
- F9         Set breakpoint
- F10        Step over
- F11        Step into
- Ctrl+F9    Run

Important know how:

- CMake supports generating Codelite projects. However, the generated projects are
  suitable for build only, as a single monolithic target, and needs to be customized 
  for debugging purposes.
  Alternatively, the "Quick Debug" option could be used for debugging LLVM.project.

Caveats:

- Codelite has several integration issues with ninja, such as showing build output only
  when build is done, and not being able to compile individual files. Therefore, plain
  make should be used instead.
- Debug session could take some 20 seconds to start with debug clang (1GB executable).

Quick Debug:

- Debugger -> Quick Debug
- Select Executable: /path/to/executable
- Working directory: ...
- Program arguments: ...

Debug Options:

- In Quick Debug -> Startup commands, add:   set follow-fork-mode child
  This is for gdb to follow the child process after fork.
