Virtualization
==============

- Hypercall: analogous to a system call, but instead of going from a user-space process to kernel,
  it's from a guest domain / guest kernel to hypervisor.

- Types of virtualization:
  * Full software emulation (e.g. QEMU TCG mode [Tiny Code Generator])
  * Binary translation (e.g. QEMU TCG with block caching; VirtualBox [pre-2019])
  * Para-Virtualization (PV) (e.g. Xen PV)
    - Requires guest OS support
    - Privileged instructions are replaced with hypercalls
  * Hardware-Assisted Virtualization (HVM) (e.g. KVM, Xen HVM)
    - Intel VMX instructions
  * Hybrid Virtualization (PVH, PVHVM) (e.g. Linux KVM with virtio drivers)
    - CPU hardware virtualization combined with paravirtualized drivers for efficient I/O
