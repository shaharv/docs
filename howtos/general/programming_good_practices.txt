Good Programming Practices
--------------------------

Main Principles of Good Programming:

- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

  When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single
  element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated
  elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change
  predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

  See

- KISS - Keep it simple stupid

  Simplicity (and avoiding complexity) should always be a key goal. Simple
  code takes less time to write, has fewer bugs, and is easier to modify.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

- Boy-Scout Rule

  The boy-scout rule states that we should always leave the code cleaner
  than we found it.

  Why:
  When making changes to an existing codebase the code quality tends
  to degrade, accumulating technical debt. Following the boyscout rule, we
  should mind the quality with each commit. Technical debt is resisted by
  continuous refactoring, no matter how small.

  How:
  With each commit make sure it does not degrade the codebase quality.
  Any time someone sees some code that isn’t as clear as it should be,
  they should take the opportunity to fix it right there and then.

- Code For The Maintainer

  Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a
  violent psychopath who knows where you live.
  Always code and comment in such a way that if someone a few notches junior
  picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.

- Embrace Change

  This is the subtitle of a book by Kent Beck, and is also considered a tenet
  of extreme programming and the agile methodology in general. Many other
  principles are based on the concept that you should expect and welcome change.

- Avoid Premature Optimization

  Don’t even think about optimization unless your code is working, but slower
  than you want. Only then should you start thinking about optimizing, and
  then only with the aid of empirical data.
  "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:
  premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth.

In short:

  K - KISS
  A - Avoid premature optimization
  M - code for the Maintainer
  B - Boyscout rule
  E - Embrace change
  D - DRY

Additional Guidelines:

- Globals

* http://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad
* The use of global variables is generally discouraged, and considered
  a bad practice. They make software harder to understand, debug and
  maintain.

- Comments

* http://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/05/02/to-comment-or-not-to-comment-that-is-the-question
* Code should be as expressive as possible
* Needing too much comments might indicate the code is overly complex and needs a rewrite
* Document where needed (non-trivial algorithm etc.)
* A commentary paragraph in the begining of a file - good practice
