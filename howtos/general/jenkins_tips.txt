                        (e.g. http://buildserver/jenkins/job/MyJobName/666/)

JOB_NAME                Name of the project of this build.

Jenkins HTTP troubleshooting
----------------------------

1. If Jenkins is not responding to HTTP requests - no GUI is shown,
   first view the log and look for unusual output:

   $ cat /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log

2. Try to restart the service:

   $ sudo service jenkins restart

   If that doesn't work, forcibly kill the process and then start the service again:

   $ sudo pkill -9 -f 'java.*jenkins.war'
   $ sudo service jenkins start

3. For further troubleshooting steps, see:
   https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins

4. If needed, run the following command instead to generate the keystore
   and certificate:

   $ keytool -genkeypair -keysize 2048 -keyalg RSA -alias jenkins -keystore keystore -validity 3650
