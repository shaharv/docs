Data Locality
-------------

- Great friendly optimization guide, game oriented:

  Memory could be kept contagious by keeping together objects of same
  types (in arrays), using contagious containers (e.g. vector over list),
  avoiding polymorphism, etc. See above.

TLB

- Overview:

- TLB vs. data cache:
  https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/18313/how-does-a-tlb-and-data-cache-work

- The TLB is a cache for the virtual address to physical address lookup. 
  The page tables provide a way to map virtualaddress -> physicaladdress, by looking 
  up the virtual address in the page tables. However, doing the lookup in the page 
  tables is slow (it involves 2-3 memory loads). If the processor had to do this 
  lookup every time any instruction accessed memory, this would cause a substantial
  slowdown.

  Therefore, the TLB acts as a dedicated cache for this lookup. The TLB has a few 
  TLB entries, where each TLB entry contains both a virtual address and its 
  corresponding physical address.

Virtual Memory
--------------

- Overview:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory

- Virtual memory makes application programming easier by hiding fragmentation of 
  physical memory; by delegating to the kernel the burden of managing the memory
  hierarchy (eliminating the need for the program to handle overlays explicitly); 
  and, when each process is run in its own dedicated address space, by obviating 
  the need to relocate program code or to access memory with relative addressing.

Paging (swapping)
-----------------

- Paging:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging

- Paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves 
  data from secondary storage for use in main memory (e.g. HD <-> RAM).
